Hi, Im Noe Gallice I’m an EPFL physics student, and before the presentation of my master thesis, I will briefly introduce my education with a little tour of Epfl, so after my bachelor in physics I move to the East side of the campus for my Master and I joined the Laboratory of statitical biophysics of Paolo de los Rios.

I then to discover the West-side of the campus doing a minor in computational neuroscience  which reveal to me the intriguing world of neuroscience. I did my Minor Project in the Laboratory of Wulfram Gerstner, and my work focus on the influence of surprise in human behavior. And I had the great chance to continue in the lab for my master project working on a complete different topic that I will present to you now

My work focus and deriving a low dimensional population dynamics using eigenfunction expansion, I will not have the time to go deeply into the theoretical derivations. But I will present you the main idea and some results.

In the brain billion of neurons form complex network, they communicate with each other by short electrical pulse called action potential. and we can describe those action potential at different level 

 (C) Biophysical  model, where we can describe The ion currents flowing through the cell membrane which can generate action potentials 

At the next level of abstraction (B), action potentials are treated as events called spikes. Arrivals of spikes from other neurons generate postsynaptic potentials, and the neuron emit a spike whenever the membrane potential u  crosses a threshold ϑ 



(A) at the macroscopic scale. We can identify groups of neurons having similar property and interacting by their population activity, So it might be interesting to look the response of the neuronal population whether than the spikes of individual neurons.

So we might ask…

A common approach to recover the activity is based on the refractory density,

So we consider a large homogenous population of neurons and the state of each neurons is describe by it’s age, the time passed since it’s last spike.

Here is a scheme of the refractory density or the density of age at a certain time. So you can see this as an histogram where each bin would correspond to the number of neurons in the population with a similar age. And q goes to zero as it’s not likely that the neuron never fires.

As long as a neuron does not fire, it’s age $\tau$ increase and so the evolution of the refractory density would be simply given by this continuity equation.

When a neuron fires, it’s trajectory $\tau$ stops and "reappears" at $\tau=0$. The instantaneous probability to fire is given by the hazard function \rho(\tau,h)

So the full dynamics is describe by this equation

The sum of all trajectory that "disappear" at time $t$ due to firing, are "reappearing" at $\tau=0$
Which correspond to this integral. And therefor it corresponds also to the activity

The problem of this integral formulation is that infinite demential and not computationally efficient…


Todo aim ….

So here is the refractory density equation we just rederived before, we can rewrite it introducing a this operator L 

And we can expand the refractory density on the eigenfunction phi_n set of the operator

Here an the time dependent coefficients. I dont have the time to show you and explain all the derivation I did but the major part of my work was devoted in finding general expression for the eigenfunctions, and to derive the dynamics of this time coefficient. 

The idea was then to keep the two slowest mode of this expansion, and from this I derived a three dimensional system, which is easy to simulate. 

Here I’ll we show you some details 

Here are the results of the approximation to a sinuoidal modulation of the external input.

for the response of a couple and uncoupled population of poisson neuron with absolute refractoriness, 

we see that it’s approximate well the response calculating using the integral form. 



This master thesis confirmed my motivation to do research in the field of theoretical neuroscience and I think that pursuing a PhD at LCN would be the prefect place, and the natural continuity of my education. 

I think that my physics background, and 

I would like to thanks my supervisor Tilo, and the director of my thesis wulfram and Matthieu for their great help with this project. 


And the results of this low dimensional approximation are really promising and would be very interessant to extend this work to more complicated hazard rate function, that match with experimental measurement.
