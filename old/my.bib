In both, we find that the low common input regime is governed by firing rate dependent spike correlations which are sensitive to the detailed structure of input correlation functions. In the high common input regime, the spike correlations are largely insensitive to the firing rate and exhibit a universal peak shape. We further show that pairs with different firing rates driven by common inputs in general exhibit asymmetric spike correlations.},

We show that networks of tonically firing adapting excitatory neurons can evolve to a state where the neurons burst in a synchronized manner. The mechanism leading to this burst activity is analyzed in a network of integrate-and-fire neurons with spike adaptation. The dependence of this state on the different network parameters is investigated, and it is shown that this mechanism is robust against inhomogeneities, sparseness of the connectivity, and noise. In networks of two populations, one excitatory and one inhibitory, we show that decreasing the inhibitory feedback can cause the network to switch from a tonically active, asynchronous state to the synchronized bursting state. Finally, we show that the same mechanism also causes synchronized burst activity in networks of more realistic conductance-based model neurons.},

	volume = {100},
	abstract = {Many neurons exhibit subthreshold membrane-potential resonances, such that the largest voltage responses occur at preferred stimulation frequencies. Because subthreshold resonances are known to influence the rhythmic activity at the network level, it is vital to understand how they affect spike generation on the single-cell level. We therefore investigated both resonant and nonresonant neurons of rat entorhinal cortex. A minimal resonate-and-fire type model based on measured physiological parameters captures fundamental properties of neuronal firing statistics surprisingly well and helps to shed light on the mechanisms that shape spike patterns: 1) subthreshold resonance together with a spike-induced reset of subthreshold oscillations leads to spike clustering and 2) spike-induced dynamics influence the fine structure of interspike interval {(ISI)} distributions and are responsible for {ISI} correlations appearing at higher firing rates ([â¥]3 Hz). Both mechanisms are likely to account for the specific discharge characteristics of various cell types.

Using analytically tractable model, we contrast signal detection in two situations: (i) when the neuron is driven by coherent oscillations and (ii) when the coherence of oscillations is destroyed. Analytical calculations revealed a region in the parameter space of the model where oscillations act to reduce the variability of neuronal firing and to enhance the discriminability of weak signals. These analytical results are employed to unveil a possible role of coherent oscillations in peripheral electrosensory system of paddlefish in improvement of detection of weak stimuli. The proposed mechanism may be relevant to a wide range of phenomena involving coherently driven oscillators.},

year = {2000},
abstract = {The spike trains that transmit information between neurons are stochastic. We used the theory of random point processes and simulation methods to investigate the influence of temporal correlation of synaptic input current on firing statistics. The theory accounts for two sources for temporal correlation: synchrony between spikes in presynaptic input trains and the unitary synaptic current time course. Simulations show that slow temporal correlation of synaptic input leads to high variability in firing. In a leaky integrate-and-fire neuron model with spike afterhyperpolarization the theory accurately predicts the firing rate when the spike threshold is higher than two standard deviations of the membrane potential fluctuations. For lower thresholds the spike afterhyperpolarization reduces the firing rate below the theory's predicted level when the synaptic correlation decays rapidly. If the synaptic correlation decays slower than the spike afterhyperpolarization, spike bursts can occur during single broad peaks of input fluctuations, increasing the firing rate over the prediction. Spike bursts lead to a coefficient of variation for the interspike intervals that can exceed one, suggesting an explanation of high coefficient of variation for interspike intervals observed in vivo.

	abstract = {Information processing in neocortex can be very fast, indicating that neuronal ensembles faithfully transmit rapidly changing signals to each other. Apart from signal-to-noise issues, population codes are fundamentally constrained by the neuronal dynamics. In particular, the biophysical properties of individual neurons and collective phenomena may substantially limit the speed at which a graded signal can be represented by the activity of an ensemble. These implications of the neuronal dynamics are rarely studied experimentally. Here, we combine theoretical analysis and whole cell recordings to show that encoding signals in the variance of uncorrelated synaptic inputs to a neocortical ensemble enables faithful transmission of graded signals with high temporal resolution. In contrast, the encoding of signals in the mean current is subject to low-pass filtering.},

abstract = {Object recognition and classification by sensory pathways is rooted in spike trains provided by sensory neurons. Nervous systems had to evolve mechanisms to extract information about relevant object properties, and to separate these from spurious features. In this review, problems caused by spike train variability and counterstrategies are exemplified for the processing of acoustic signals in orthopteran insects. Due to size limitations of their nervous system we expect to find solutions that are stripped to the computational basics. A key feature of auditory systems is temporal resolution, which is likely limited by spike train variability. Basic strategies to reduce such variability are to integrate over time, or to average across several neurons. The first strategy is constrained by its possible interference with temporal resolution. Grasshoppers do not seem to explore temporal integration much, in spite of the repetitive structure of their songs, which invites for 'multiple looks' at the signal. The benefits of averaging across neurons depend on uncorrelated responses, a factor that may be crucial for the performance and evolution of small nervous systems. In spite of spike train variability the temporal information necessary for the recognition of conspecifics is preserved to a remarkable degree in the auditory pathway.},

	publisher = {Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory},
	abstract = {Locomotion profoundly changes sensory responses in mouse primary visual cortex. These changes are thought to arise from a disinhibitory circuit, whereby interneurons expressing vasoactive intestinal peptide (Vip) inhibit those expressing somatostatin (Sst), thus disinhibiting pyramidal cells (Pyr). We studied the effect of locomotion on these cell types and on interneurons expressing parvalbumin (Pvalb) in layer 2/3 of mouse V1, and found inconsistencies with the disinhibitory model. Locomotion increased Sst cell responses to large stimuli and to full field gray screen, without decreasing them in Vip cells. Moreover, it increased Vip cell responses to small stimuli, without decreasing them in Sst cells. Signal and noise correlations between cell types provided further evidence against the disinhibitory model. Our data resolve apparent contradictions in the literature and suggest an alternative to the disinhibitory model, where Vip and Sst cells inhibit each other in a circuit whose effect depends on stimulus and behavioral state.},

	abstract = {Synchronous spiking of neural populations is hypothesized to play important computational roles in forming neural assemblies and solving the binding problem. Although the opposite phenomenon of desynchronization is well known from {EEG} studies, it is largely neglected on the neuronal level. We here provide an example of in vivo recordings from weakly electric fish demonstrating that, depending on the social context, different types of natural communication signals elicit transient desynchronization as well as synchronization of the electroreceptor population without changing the mean firing rate. We conclude that, in general, both positive and negative changes in the degree of synchrony can be the relevant signals for neural information processing.},

abstract = {In the idling brain, neuronal circuits transition between periods of sustained firing (UP state) and quiescence (DOWN state), a pattern the mechanisms of which remain unclear. Here we analyzed spontaneous cortical population activity from anesthetized rats and found that UP and DOWN durations were highly variable and that population rates showed no significant decay during UP periods. We built a network rate model with excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) populations exhibiting a novel bistable regime between a quiescent and an inhibition-stabilized state of arbitrarily low rate. Fluctuations triggered state transitions, while adaptation in E cells paradoxically caused a marginal decay of E-rate but a marked decay of I-rate in UP periods, a prediction that we validated experimentally. A spiking network implementation further predicted that DOWN-to-UP transitions must be caused by synchronous high-amplitude events. Our findings provide evidence of bistable cortical networks that exhibit non-rhythmic state transitions when the brain rests.},

	volume = {10},
	abstract = {The firing reliability and precision of an isopotential membrane patch consisting of a realistically large number of ion channels is investigated using a stochastic {Hodgkin-Huxley} {(HH)} model. In sharp contrast to the deterministic {HH} model, the biophysically inspired stochastic model reproduces qualitatively the different reliability and precision characteristics of spike firing in response to {DC} and fluctuating current input in neocortical neurons, as reported by Mainen \& Sejnowski (1995). For {DC} inputs, spike timing is highly unreliable; the reliability and precision are significantly increased for fluctuating current input. This behavior is critically determined by the relatively small number of excitable channels that are opened near threshold for spike firing rather than by the total number of channels that exist in the membrane patch. Channel fluctuations, together with the inherent bistability in the {HH} equations, give rise to three additional experimentally observed phenomena: subthreshold oscillations in the membrane voltage for {DC} input, “spontaneous” spikes for subthreshold inputs, and “missing” spikes for suprathreshold inputs. We suggest that the noise inherent in the operation of ion channels enables neurons to act as “smart” encoders. Slowly varying, uncorrelated inputs are coded with low reliability and accuracy and, hence, the information about such inputs is encoded almost exclusively by the spike rate. On the other hand, correlated presynaptic activity produces sharp fluctuations in the input to the postsynaptic cell, which are then encoded with high reliability and accuracy. In this case, information about the input exists in the exact timing of the spikes. We conclude that channel stochasticity should be considered in realistic models of neurons.},

In an examination of the reliability of spike generation using recordings from neurons in rat neocortical slices, the precision of spike timing was found to depend on stimulus transients. Constant stimuli led to imprecise spike trains, whereas stimuli with fluctuations resembling synaptic activity produced spike trains with timing reproducible to less than 1 millisecond. These data suggest a low intrinsic noise level in spike generation, which could allow cortical neurons to accurately transform synaptic input into spike sequences, supporting a possible role for spike timing in the processing of cortical information by the neocortex.},
